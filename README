Lightweight collection of the most commonly used boost headers. Access convenient boost utilities, such as smart pointers or tuples, without introducing boost as dependency.

Some of the headers are directly from boost; others are workarounds or have been reimplemented by me. These may not be fully compliant with the original headers.

The collection currently contains: 
 - tuple (up to 5 elements)
 - shared_ptr (not threadsafe)
 - shared_array
 - foreach (limited version)
 - format (pipes to a stringstream)
 - lexical_cast (uses stringstream)
 - make_shared (dummy, does not do a compact alloc)
 - noncopyable
 - pointer_cast
 - static_assert
 - timer 
 - math/common_factor (lcm,gcd)
 

Originally, this collection evolved as part of assimp (http://assimp.sf.net). During development, we realized that boost is not as widespread as we believed, and therefore some users might avoid assimp because of this dependency on boost. Maintaining a small collection of boost 'workaround' scripts turned out to be an easy solution.
